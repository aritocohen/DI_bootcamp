RULES:

The game is played on a grid thatâ€™s 3 squares by 3 squares.

Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
