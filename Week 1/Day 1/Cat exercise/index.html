	<h2>The lions</h2><br>
	Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.<br>
	It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at<br> night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and<br>
	composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when<Br>
	hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.<br>
